      Hi everyone, my name is Nishthha Pandya. I am currently 16 years old and I live in Georgia. My hobbies include dancing, keeping up with the NBA, and working with multimedia technologies. I am also enjoying how to learn coding in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, and I hope to gain a lot more knowledge from this program!
